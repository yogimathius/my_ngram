# Welcome to My Ngram
***

## Task

the problem we ran into was handeling any number arguments from the comandline, as well as sorting the results alphabeticaly.

## Description

in out main we added conditions that handeled having no inputs and as well as joining all the arguments given
to creat one string to work with. then before we looped though the string to count the occurences of each character we ran
a seperate function to sort it alphabeticaly. 

## Installation
How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?

not aplicable

## Usage

Our program works by taking arguments form the comand line and combine them into one string in our main. after that we go to 
my_ngram function and sort our string alphabeticaly. then in our main we loop through our stirng chexking to see if we have 
already counted that character or if it is new. if that character has already been counted then we move on, if it hasn't then
we loop theough the whole string and count all occurences of that character then print out the letter with it's count and 
add the letter to our already counted array.

```
./my_project argument1 argument2
